Safe Mother, Safe Babies is a non-profit organization whose goal is to increase health facility access to pregnant mothers residing in Ugandan Villages. The organization relies on data collection of Mothers and volunteer drivers whose information is stored on a database and accessed for risk evaluation and SMS communication purposes. The app consists of several parts:

- Administrative Dashboard that will display mother and driver data from the database.
- Allow the user to perform CRUD operations on the available data
- Give the user the ability to upload data
- Interact and control the dispatch of drivers to mothers in need

###  Key Features

-    Mother CRUD functions
-    Driver CRUD functions
-    Administrative user CRUD functions



## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

React

We chose these frameworks because:

- Scalability
- Ease of readability for the next team who builds on to this project
- Vast selection of libraries to aid in accomplishing our goal
- React's virtual DOM in ReactJS makes for faster development and better user experience
- Allows us to specify various configurations and build reusable components

## Libraries

- axios
- formik
- yup
- react-dom
- react-redux
- react-router-dom
- react-scripts
- redux-persist
- redux-thunk

# UI Design Libraries

- grommet
- grommet-icons
- styled-components
- priceline-design-system
- react-inlinesvg

#### Front end deployed to Heroku

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/safe-mothers-be) built using:

#    NodeJS + ExpressJS

- Allows for quick building of scalable network applications
- REST API is predictable, and doesn't expose database architecture to FE
- Clean and organized code using packages/middleware for validation, error handling, etc.

## Libraries 

- axios
- bcryptjs
- cors
- dotenv
- express
- fuse. js
- helmet
- jsonwebtoken
- knex
- knex-cleaner
- pg 
- sqlite3

# APIs

API documentation can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6290768/SW7UcWoB?version=latest)

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    REACT_APP_API_URL- will be the base URL for the specific back-end server that the client will be using.
    REACT_APP_MIXPANEL_TOKEN= store MixPanel token here for analytics (required for Mixpanel)
    REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=production (required for Mixpanel analytics)
    ** Mixpanel needs the REACT_APP_NODE_ENV variable set to "production" for it to work. **
    
# Installation Instructions

### Installation

**Step 1:** Clone Repo

**Step 2:** Install node modules

```
npm install
```

**Step 3:** To start app on local host

```
npm start
```
  _Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

_The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**Step 4:** configure for backend

 - https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/safe-mothers-be
 
 will be the base URL for the specific back-end server that the client will be using.

**\*\*NOTE\*\*** - `npm start` is the same as running `expo start`
