Safe Mother, Safe Babies is a non-profit organization whose goal is to increase health facility access to pregnant mothers residing in Ugandan Villages. The organization relies on data collection of Mothers and volunteer drivers whose information is stored on a database and accessed for risk evaluation and SMS communication purposes. The app consists of several parts:

- Administrative Dashboard that will display mother and driver data from the database.
- Allow the user to perform CRUD operations on the available data
- Give the user the ability to upload data
- Interact and control the dispatch of drivers to mothers in need

###  Key Features

-    Mother can register her information using a phone with SMS capabilities
-    feature two
-    feature three

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    * create .env file in each place as follow:
       *  REACT_APP_MIXPANEL_TOKEN= store MixPanel token here for analytics
        *  REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=production (required for mixpanel analytics)
        *.env (contains all the environment variables for production)
    
    `REACT_APP_API_URL`- will be the base URL for the specific back-end server that the client will be using.
    `REACT_APP_MIXPANEL_TOKEN`- needs to be set if the person wants to use MixPanel analytics tools.
    ** MixPanel needs the REACT_APP_NODE_ENV variable set to "production" for it to work.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Instructions

**Installation**

Step 1: Clone Repo

Step 2: Install node modules

npm install

Step 3: To start app on local host

npm start
  ** Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Step 4: configure for backend

 https://staging-be-labs17-safe.herokuapp.com/ 
 
 will be the base URL for the specific back-end server that the client will be using.

**NOTE** - npm start is the same as running expo start


## Other Scripts

üö´replace these examples with your own

    * typecheck - runs the TypeScript compiler
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
